*DESCRIPTION* "For this task, I developed Python-based tools to detect vulnerabilities and test security features in systems and web applications. I began by creating a file integrity checker, where I used the hashlib library to calculate and compare hash values of files. This tool helped me monitor changes in files by detecting any unauthorized modifications, ensuring that the files remain unchanged over time. I wrote the script, tested it by modifying .txt files, and observed how hash mismatches indicated tampering. Next, I created a web application vulnerability scanner using the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries. This tool scans forms on a website, submits test inputs, and checks for vulnerabilities like SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). I learned how to identify and extract form data from HTML, send payloads to the server, and analyze the responses for signs of vulnerabilities. During the process, I faced issues like broken pip installation, which I resolved by reinstalling Python and setting it up correctly. I also practiced working with sample websites to simulate and understand how the scanner behaves in real scenarios. These tools were developed with step-by-step guidance, and I gained hands-on experience in using Python for ethical hacking and penetration testing purposes. This project helped me understand how security tools work behind the scenes and how they can be used to strengthen the security posture of web applications and systems.
